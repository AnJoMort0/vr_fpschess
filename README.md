# VR Battle Chess (placeholder name) 🚀✨🤖

Welcome to VR Battle Chess, where strategy meets adrenaline in the ultimate fusion of chess and first-person shooter action! ⚔️👑

## Inspired by "FPS Chess" 🤯🎮

VR Battle Chess draws inspiration from the innovative "FPS Chess" game, where the boundaries of traditional chess are shattered by rogue knights with sniper trick-shots and queens armed with randomly sprayed machine guns. Say goodbye to predictable openings and hello to unexpected sword duels! ⚔️🏰

**Note: This project is a work in progress and a school project. Stay tuned for updates as we bring the chess battlefield to the immersive world of virtual reality!** 🚧👀

## Planned Long Term Features 🎮🌟

- **Chess, Reloaded:** Challenge your friends or foes to an extraordinary game of chess where your moves trigger intense first-person shooter duels.
  
- **Unique Piece Toolkits:** Experience chess like never before with 6 unique piece toolkits, each armed with distinct weapons and abilities. Will your rook take the high ground with a sniper rifle, or will the queen rain chaos with a machine gun? 🔫🤖

- **Explore the Arena:** Immerse yourself in the fun-filled room designed for every duel. Who said chess had to be serious? Take a breather between battles and explore your surroundings. 🏰🤔

- **Create Your Board:** Unleash your creativity with the custom board editor. Choose your favorite pieces and customize the battlefield to suit your strategic whims. 🎨🕹️
